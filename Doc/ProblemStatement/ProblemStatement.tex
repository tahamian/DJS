\section{The Problem}
Social gatherings where none of the guests are enjoying the music.
\section{How We Will Solve It}
We will solve the problem by creating a democratic voting system which allows
all opinions to be heard. The voting system will give users the ability to
change the music to their liking.

\section{Why is this an important Problem?}
The problem is important to end users because it allows party hosts the ability
to let guests choose music which in turn incorporates everyone's taste.
Furthermore, the party host does not have to worry about catering to the guests
and wonder about the music (for example, what genre to play).

\section{Context}
The problem recolves around social gatherings of any kind that involve music.
Parties, Weddings, and Conferences are prime examples. Nobody wants to be at an
event where the guests aren't feeling the music. The dance floor will be
empty, and the mood will be somber. This is the type of situation our app
remedies. Music that everybody enjoys will lift the guests moods, and make
the event more fun.

\section{Stakeholders}
People who attend events and the people who organize them are stakeholders of
this product. It is important to make sure that people hear what they want,
rather than being forced to listen to what someone else decides.

\section{Environment}
The server (back-end) will be written in a combination of Node.JS, Express,
and MySQL. The web app (front-end) will be built with conventional web
technology (HTML, CSS, Javascript).
