\maketitle
\textcolor{red}{ This can be included in an Abstract section - CM} \\
Good planning is an essential part of solving any problem, also an essential part of the engineering process. To work as a team efficiently and effectively we have to have develop \textcolor{red}{ Fix typo - CM} plans that we should follow, and assign roles to each member.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
\textcolor{red}{Include more details regarding time, duration, roles, follow-up material.. etc. - CM} \\
The team meetings will be held every week on Thursday at Thode Library. In the meetings the group will discuss problems, milestones due, and plan a schedule for the following week. If a team member fails to meet with the group or does not complete deliverables the team member will have to buy coffee for the team.
\section{Team Communication Plan}
The team will mainly communicate which each other through a group chat in facebook \textcolor{red}{ Facebook is a proper noun - CM}. The group chat will be used to notify the group any time someone commits on GitLab. We also have contact information such as phone numbers if anything urgent comes up. \textcolor{red}{What constitutes SMS or phone communication?  - CM} 
\section{Team Member Roles}
Team member roles will be governed by these rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There will be no team leader in our group, because we believe in equality. \textcolor{red}{ Designating a Team Leader does not imply inequality, reword rationale towards something closer to having equal skillset or how you plan of team governing this project - CM} 
\item We will have a scribe in the group and that will be Amandeep Panesar.
\item We will try and make sure the work is evenly spread as possible between group members.
\begin{itemize}
\item Victor specializes in Javascript and Git. He will focus on both back end design and implementation.
\item Amandeep specializes in documentation and using a server. He will focus more on the design and implementing a server.
\item Taha specializes in LaTex and Javascript. He will focus on more of the front end design and implementation and the documentation \textcolor{red}{Avoid using more than 2 ands when listing things. Use a comma instead and finish with \textit{and} - CM} 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Git Workflow Plan}
\textcolor{red}{Find a commonly used Git Workflow type and use that. Also, how will you handle pull requests?  - CM} \\
The team will begin working on the open source project on Gitlab with the single repository. The contributors for the project will attempt to commit often and will only push refined code to the master branch. However, the development code will be implemented in private branches which will be merged when bugs, and problematic code is fixed. In addition, the code should have frequent commits with small changes to avoid merge conflicts and large rollbacks.
\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
\textcolor{red}{Give more detail into the difficulties of reaching this milestone and how to work to preventing failure  - CM} \\
The proof of concept demonstation will display the server and the front end of the system. The front end of the project will only allow you to pick and play one song and will not include the voting aspect of the project. For the server aspect of the demonstration the song selected will play through the external speakers. The goal of this demonstration is to get the frontend client communicating with the server side and will allow us to verify that the project is feasible.
\section{Technology}
\textcolor{red}{When mentioning a software name, it is common to type it verbatim as the developers would use it. For example, Node.js and Express - CM} \\
The software will be designed with primarily Node.JS (\textcolor{red}{ Restructure sentence - CM} ) and traditional web technologies.

\textcolor{red}{ Format the below into a list - CM}  \\
Server: Express.JS
Back-end: Javascript (via Node.JS)
Web-app: HTML/CSS/JS as well as jQuery/AngularJS/Handlebars
UI: Bootstrap

\section{Coding Style}
We will be using the Javascript coding style found \href{http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html}{here.}
We are using this coding convention because the code looks clear and concise with minimal whitespaces making it to read debug the code \textcolor{red}{Restructure sentence - CM} . Its imporant for code to have a long life cycle and this is one of the most standard ways to present javascript code \textcolor{red}{Typo and restructure - CM} .

\section{Project Schedule}
\textcolor{red}{ Color tasks based on classification, provide more detail on project milestones - CM} \\
