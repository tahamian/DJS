\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to make it easier for people that attend social
gatherings or events to select a songs and form their own playlist according to
the mood or perference of the attendees. \\

Social gatherings are much more enjoyable when most of the attendee's enjoy
the music that is being played. This project was inspired by \\

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
Stakeholders will be people who attend these social events or gatherings and
people who host them. \\

\textbf{Event Attendee's}
If the system is working properly and attendee's are voting for songs, then
the event will be more enjoyable for them.

\textbf{Event Organizer(s)}
Having users select music will put less stress on the event organizers, and
allow them to focus on other aspects of the event, or let them enjoy
themselves.

\subsubsection{The Client}

The client is the host of the social event or gathering, could also be a DJ
who's not willing to put up with people fighting over what song to play next.
Could also be the host whose trying to save money not hiring a Dj and just
relying on this system that allows the attnedees to chose what song they want
to play.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
Amandeeps Dad

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders could be music producers or licensors because music that is
played should be legally attainted for the event, not pirated.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\begin{list_type}
\item The first item
\item The second item
\item The third etc \ldots
\end{list_type}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\section{Functional Requirements}

- Allow users to vote on which song to play next at a social gathering \\
- Users can select to vote for any of a pre-determined set of \\
  approximately 10 songs. \\
- The predetermined set of songs can be selected randomly from a larger pool \\
  of songs \\
- Queue up songs that have been voted on and automatically play them \\
- Provide a simple web-app for users to vote with. The web-app has a list that
  shows users what their options to pick from are \\

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}

- Visually pleasing web app interface
<<<<<<< HEAD

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Straight-forward web app (new users should be able to adopt it easily)
\item No sign up required
\item Automatically connects to server via WiFi with little to no input from user
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Songs should play one after another with small or no delay in between
\item Server should have high uptime
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

- Straight-forward web app (new users should be able to adopt it easily) \\
- No sign up required \\
- Automatically connects to server via WiFi with little to no input from user \\

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

- Songs should play one after another with small or no delay in between \\
- Server should have high uptime \\

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

- A user should only be allowed to vote once per \textit{'round'} of votes \\
- Restarting the app/WiFi/phone should not change the fact that a user can only
  vote once per \textit{'round'} \\

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}
- Music that is played should have legal rights to be played publically \\
\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

- How exactly do we make sure that a user can only vote once per song, without
  requiring people to sign up for an account \\

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

The project that we are modelling (PlayMyWay) already does most of what our
project will do.

As for other solutions, there are various libraries that we will use in our
development. These libraries will help with various functionality, and include
(but are not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
\item Express.JS (Server framework for Node.JS)
\item Angular.JS (Front-end framework for the web app)
\item nodeunit (Unit testing package)
\item Mocha (general testing package)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{New Problems}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

\subsection{Risks}
-The product is a webapp and therefore relies on an internet connection. \\
- Bugs or catastrophic errors in the server could cause the music to start
  playing. \\
\subsection{Costs}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{Waiting Room}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
