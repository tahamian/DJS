\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team meetings will be held every week on Thursday at Thode Library. In the meetings the group will discuss problems, milestones due, and plan a schedule for the following week. 
\section{Team Communication Plan}
The team will mainly communicate which each other through a group chat in facebook. We also have each other phone numbers if anything urgent comes up.  
\section{Team Member Roles}
There will be no team leader in our group, becasue we believe in equality. We will have a scribe in the group and that will be Amandeep Panesar.  
\section{Git Workflow Plan}
The team will begin working on the open source project on Gitlab with the single repository. The contributors for the project will attempt to commit often and will only push refined code to the master branch.However, the development code will be implemented in private branches which will be merged when bugs, and problematic code is fixed. In addition, the code should have frequent commits with small changes to avoid merge conflicts and large rollbacks.
